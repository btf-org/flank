# Run a script on a schedule

(This assumes your script is already written and lives in a file on your machine...)

1. **Install Flank** - [See here](/docs/install_flank.md)
2. **Go to the Flank website** - This will be at http://localhost:8083 by default
3. **Add your script to Flank** - From the website , click on "Create Cmd" on the bottom bar
4. **Create a cron job** - If you're not already, drill into your newly created command and click on "Create Cron" on the bottom bar
5. **View Logs** - If you're not already, drill into your newly created command and click "History" on the bottom bar

**Next:** Always pull the latest version of the script from a repo
