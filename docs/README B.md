# Flank

Flank is a dedicated UI for running scripts. 

## Flank is for frequent script-runners

Flank is an app that replaces `python myscript.py` in the CLI, in the same way that Postman replaces `curl`.

## More features than CLI

If you run scripts frequently, a dedicated app can make your life easier: 

* Share with a teammate and unblock yourself
* Run a script away from your desk
* Search the output of a script run last week

## Lightyears faster than a designed app

Normally if you get sick of running a script, you expose it through a designed app.

With Flank, all you do is run `iflank wrap myscript.py` and you're done. No frontend code. No deployment.
