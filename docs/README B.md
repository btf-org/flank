# Flank

Flank is a dedicated UI for running scripts. 

## Flank is for frequent script-runners

Flank is an app that replaces `python myscript.py [Enter]`, in the same way that Postman replaces `curl`.

## More features than CLI

If you run scripts frequently, a dedicated app can offer more features than the CLI.

Some examples of how this might make your life easier: 

* Share with a teammate and unblock yourself
* Run a script away from your desk
* Search the output of a script run last week

## Lightyears faster than a designed app

Features for non-technical teammates normally skip the "script phase" and jump straight to designed apps: internal tools, dashboards, business intelligence, etc.

With Flank, all you do is run `iflank wrap myscript.py` and you're done. No frontend code. No deployment.
