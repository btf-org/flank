# Flank

Flank is an app for running your scripts.

In the same way that Postman is a dedicated UI for `curl`, Flank is a dedicated UI for `python myscript.py`.

## Flank is for frequent script-runners

There is overhead in having a separate app, and, generally, it's only worth it if you spend a lot of time running scripts. This is doubly true if you run scripts on behalf of other people.

## Fast x Safe

Flank 
Normally you'd run a script from the CLI by typing in `python filter-data.py ...`. Flank is a dedicated app that replaces that process, with the following advantages:

- Inputs fields
- Stores history of all runs (both inputs and outputs)
- Non-engineers can use it

## Advantages over exposing a script through a web app

- It's as fast as the CLI
