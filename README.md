# Flank
Flank is a CLI wrapper, in some situations, can shortcut the need for "dashboards", "internal tools", "BI", and cloud services. It allows backend engineers, database developers, and data scientists to solve problems end-to-end, in the language of their choice, without the usual mess of JIRA tickets, product managers, Slack messages, and DSLs.
